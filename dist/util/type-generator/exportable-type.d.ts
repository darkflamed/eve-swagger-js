/**
 * The visit callback is called *after* all of the node's children have
 * been visited. The type graph is a DAG so a type may be visited multiple
 * times. This state is captured by different arguments to the function.
 * First, `priorVisitResult` is the value that visit() last returned for
 * this node or undefined if the node has never been visited before.
 *
 * The `path` array specifies the current node and all edges traveled to get
 * to the current node. The last element in the array represents the current
 * node, and the corresponding `key` value is the dependency name to go from
 * its parent to the current.
 *
 * If a node is visited multiple times due to dependency structure, each time
 * visit() is called it will have a different parentPath value. The root of the
 * visitation call (not necessarily the root of the DAG) will have a path of
 * length 1 and its key will be the empty string.
 *
 * The `childResults` map holds the return values of the visitor being
 * applied to each of `type`'s dependencies. The visitor will have been
 * called with a parent path equivalent to `parentPath` with `type` appended
 * to it.
 *
