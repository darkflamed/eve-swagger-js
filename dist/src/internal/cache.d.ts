/**
 * Cache is a simple in-memory cache implementation based off wrapping the
 * standard Map type. It supports expiring cache entries based off of fixed
 * points in the future (set via a TTL per entry, or with a default).
 *
 * Each Cache maintains an internal timer that only runs when the cache contains
 * expiring entries. Thus, it will eventually be automatically cleaned up when
 * the Cache is otherwise eligible for GC: no new entries will be added, the
 * cached values expire, it becomes empty, and then no new timer is enqueued.
 * However, the timers are marked as unref'ed so that the process can be
 * terminated early even if entries may expire far into the future.
 *
 * However, if entries have very long expirations they could prevent the
 * automatic GC of the cache for quite some time. If possible it is recommended
 * to {@link #clear()} the cache when it is no longer going to be used.
 *
 * Note that this cache implementation does not impose any limits on the size
 * of the cache, size of keys, or size of values.
